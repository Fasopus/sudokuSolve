Simple sudoku solver using various search methods. 3 Functions are supplied as well as 3 sudoku puzzles, each function using a slighty different method/combination of heuristics to solve the puzzles.

Puzzles are translated to input by simply converting them to strings row by row, with each character in the string representing the number in the cell (ie: all strings are 81 chars long). The number 0 represents blank cells.
